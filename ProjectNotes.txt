Scaffold-DbContext "server=165.22.89.128;port=3306;database=u1072762_chldr;user=admin;password=password" Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql -OutputDir Models

Dto (Used to transfer objects)
	FromModel (all editable objects must implement this: word, phrase, text, translation)

Model (Used in normal cases)
	FromDto (When receiving from API, Which objects really need this?)
	FromEntity (When reading from local db, all objects implement this)

Entity (Used to save/change objects in the database)
	FromDto (all editable objects must implement this: word, phrase, text, translation)

* Except for the Dto objects, all others (persistent objects) must have closed constructors
* Use "FromBaseInterface" to extract assignments which are in a shared interface - to prevent code duplication
