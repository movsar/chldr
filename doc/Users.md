# User Types

There are three types of users:
1. Regular
2. Moderator
3. Bot

### Regular

Regular users are the default user type, the permission is calculated according to the Rating document 

### Moderator

Moderators are governed by the same rules as **regular** users but will have access to more functions and abilities in the future. Among them: Managing trash, User management actions, analytics etc

### Bot

Bots are used by external systems to perform CRUD operations on the main database. However, their scope is limited by their own sources, meaning **bots** cannot perform any operations except for retrieval of entities added to sources that they had not created.
